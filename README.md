# DDDNorth 2017 Demos
This repo contains demos for the *Enhancing your enterprise with modern Windows apps* DDD North 2017 session. 
The demo solution contains three parts:

1. Taking your current Win32 executable and wrapping it in a UWP container.
- This demo shows a simple WinForms application using a traditional data grid control to visualize a list of items. 

2. Enhancing your current Win32 executable with UWP APIs.
- This demo shows the same simple WinForms application, but this version takes advantage of the UWP payments API from the code executed in Win32.

3. Going full UWP with modern XAML.
- This demo shows the same concept for the WinForms application but now is a complete UWP app with XAML UI taking advantage of new features in UWP such as Fluent Design and the open source DataGrid control from Telerik.
